# Locker Problem


# Description
A high school has 1000 students and 1000 lockers, one locker for each student. On the first day of school, the principal plays the following game: She asks the first student to go and open all the lockers. She then asks the second student to go and close all the even-numbered lockers. The third student is asked to check every third locker. If it is open, the student closes it; if it is closed, the student opens it. The fourth student is asked to check every fourth locker. If it is open, the student closes it; if it is closed, the student opens it. The remaining students continue this game. In general, the nth student checks every nth locker. If the locker is open, the student closes it; if it is closed, the student opens it. After all the students have taken their turn, some of the lockers are open and some are closed. Write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter the number of lockers in a school. After the game is over, the program outputs the number of lockers that are opened.
